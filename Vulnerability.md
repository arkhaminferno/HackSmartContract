# All of these contracts didn't use safemath library,so there might be many underflow/overflow errors on those contracts.

## Exercise 1
- Should not divide by  1 either because that will destroy all fractions. Do the accounting in wei/18 decimal places and no division.
- no checking that whether you have enough tokens.

## Exercise 2


## Exercise 3

- The address that will deploy the contract will be the owner by default since there is no constructor defined or no openZepplin Owner.sol file imported in order to check msg.sender is owner.
- after becoming the owner the hacker will call setPrice function then he will set its token price to least amount (say 1 or 0).
- Since he changed the token price , he can buy as many tokens by calling buyTokens() function in least amount of cost.

## Exercise 4
 - I am not so sure. Although this clearly fits a reentrancy pattern. The .transfer function only forwards the necessary gas to make a transfer call and should guard against it.however after the Istanbul fork that may change 
 - Re Entrancy Attack on line 111
 - fix would be switching line 111 and 112.

## Exercise 5
- recordcontribution should be internal.anyone can call it 
  and record any value.

## Exercise 6
 - line 154 Should not divide by  1 either because that will destroy all fractions. Do the accounting in wei/18 decimal places and no division.
 - no checking that whether you have enough tokens.
 - line 172 could be hacked using re entrancy

## Exercise 9
- Can be Hacked using Re entrancy attack(DAO Hack that happened in 2016,3.6 millions ether stolen) on line number 249.
- if you could somehow repeatedly invoke the function redeem() over and over again.you will end up pulling the money out before its set to   zero that same thing happened in the dao.
- One fix if we switch line number 249 and 250 then hack could be prevented.

## Exercise 10

 - It would seem like party A can look at party B answer and then call headtail again if they lost.this would allow party A to get their money back and lock up the 1 eth in the contract.
  then B is locked to the input, so A can change there answer and drain the whole contract.

## Exercise 11

- re entrancy hack on line number 342 (Ether transfers that are followed by state changes may be reentrant.)
- no safemath library used could go underflow/overflow error.
- fix would be switching line 342 and 343.
