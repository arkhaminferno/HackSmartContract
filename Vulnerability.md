# All of these contracts didn't use safemath library,so there might be many underflow/overflow errors on those contracts.

## Exercise 1
- Should not divide by  1 either because that will destroy all fractions. Do the accounting in wei/18 decimal places and no division.
- no checking that whether you have enough tokens.

## Exercise 2


## Exercise 3

- The address that will deploy the contract will be the owner by default since there is no constructor defined or no openZepplin Owner.sol file imported in order to check msg.sender is owner.
-  after becoming the owner the hacker will call setPrice function then he will set its token price to least amount (say 1 or 0).
- Since he changed the token price , he can buy as many tokens by calling buyTokens() function in least amount of cost.

## Exercise 4

## Exercise 5
- recordcontribution should be internal.anyone can call it 
  and record any value.
